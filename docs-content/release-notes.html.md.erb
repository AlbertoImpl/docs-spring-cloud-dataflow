**Release Date:** September 22, 2016

Features included in this release:

* A Spring Cloud Data Flow service offering is added to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Apps Manager&reg; Services Marketplace.
* Creation of a Spring Cloud Data Flow service instance results in creation of a Spring Cloud Data Flow server application, based on Spring Boot.
* Creation of a Spring Cloud Data Flow service instance results in creation of a Spring Cloud Data Flow metrics collection application, based on Spring Boot.
* Creation of a Spring Cloud Data Flow service instance results in creation of backing MySQL for PCF and Redis for PCF service instances for use by the Data Flow service instance.
* Backing service instance types can be overridden with user-provided alternatives (for example, the tile can use an alternative MySQL service offering rather than the default MySQL for PCF).
