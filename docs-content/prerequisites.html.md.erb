## <a id="buildpack-requirements"></a>Buildpack Requirements

Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF is built using Spring Boot 1.5, which requires version 3.8 or later of the Java Cloud Foundry buildpack. The default Java buildpack---the buildpack at the lowest position of all Java buildpacks---on your PCF installation must therefore be at version 3.8 or later.

You can use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) to see the version of the Java buildpack that is currently installed.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf buildpacks
Getting buildpacks...

buildpack                position   enabled   locked   filename
java_buildpack_offline   1          true      false    java-buildpack-offline-v3.8.1.zip
ruby_buildpack           2          true      false    ruby_buildpack-cached-v1.6.19.zip
nodejs_buildpack         3          true      false    nodejs_buildpack-cached-v1.5.15.zip
go_buildpack             4          true      false    go_buildpack-cached-v1.7.10.zip
</pre>

If the default Java buildpack is older than version 3.8, you can download a newer version from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) and update Pivotal Cloud Foundry by following the instructions in the [Managing Custom Buildpacks](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/buildpacks.html) topic. To ensure that the newer buildpack is the default Java buildpack, you may delete or disable the older buildpack or make sure that the newer buildpack is in a lower position.

## <a id="product-requirements"></a>Product Requirements

Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF requires the following Pivotal Cloud Foundry products to be installed:

* [MySQL](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql)
* [RabbitMQ](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service)
* [Redis](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis)

If they are not already installed, you can follow the steps listed in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/installation.html">Installation</a> topic to install them along with Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF.
