Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF provides access to the logs generated by each Data Flow server service instance. You can view these logs either using the Service Instance Logs cf CLI plugin or by visiting the dashboard of the Spring Cloud Data Flow service broker.

## Using the cf CLI Plugin

Install the [Service Instance Logs cf CLI plugin](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/service-instance-logs-cli-plugin/), following the instructions in the [Installing](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/service-instance-logs-cli-plugin/blob/master/README.md#installing) section of the plugin's [README](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/service-instance-logs-cli-plugin/blob/master/README.md). The plugin adds a `service-instance-logs` command, which can be used to tail logs or dump recent logs for a service instance.

To tail logs for a Data Flow service instance, run `cf service-instance-logs SERVICE_NAME`, where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of the service instance:

<%= partial vars.scdf_logs_tail %>

To dump recent logs for the instance, use the `--recent` flag:

<%= partial vars.scdf_logs_tail %>

If your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment uses a self-signed certificate, you must use the `--skip-ssl-validation` flag to disable the default validation of the platform's SSL certificate:

<%= partial vars.scdf_logs_skip %>

## Using the Service Broker Dashboard

Visit the Spring Cloud Data Flow service broker's dashboard. You can access it at the following URL, where `apps.wise.com` is the application domain of your PCF deployment:

```
https://p-dataflow.apps.wise.com/
```

The dashboard shows the name, org, and space of each service instance, as well as a link to view logs for the instance.

<%= image_tag(vars.scdf_img_broker_dashboard) %>

Click the **Logs** link to view logs for a particular service instance's backing application.

<%= image_tag(vars.scdf_img_recent_logs) %>

You can stream current logs for the instance by clicking the **&#x25BA;** button.

<%= image_tag(vars.scdf_img_stream_logs) %>
