## <a id="creating"></a>Creating an Instance

You can create a Data Flow service instance using either the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) or <%= vars.scdf_platform_name %> Apps Manager.

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: If you are using the <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis/">Redis for PCF</a> product for the Spring Cloud Data Flow analytics store, you cannot create more Data Flow service instances than the setting of the Redis product's Service Instance Limit (the default Service Instance Limit for Redis for PCF is 5). See the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/redis/installing.html#shared-vm-config">Shared-VM Plan</a> section of the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/redis/installing.html">Installing and Upgrading Redis for PCF</a> topic in the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/redis/">Redis for PCF documentation</a> for information about configuring this limit.</p>

### <a id="creating-using-cf-cli"></a>Using the cf CLI

Begin by targeting the correct org and space.

<%= partial vars.scdf_managing_instances_target %>

You can view plan details for the Data Flow product using `cf marketplace -s`.

<%= partial vars.scdf_managing_instances_marketplace %>

Create the service instance using `cf create-service`.

<%= partial vars.scdf_managing_instances_create %>

As the command output suggests, you can use the `cf services` or `cf service` commands to check the status of the service instance. When the service instance is ready, the `cf service` command will give a status of `create succeeded`:

<%= partial vars.scdf_managing_instances_service %>

### <a id="creating-using-apps-manager"></a>Using Apps Manager

Log into Apps Manager as a Space Developer. In the Marketplace, select **Data Flow Server**.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scdf_managing_instances_img_marketplace) %>

Provide a name for the service instance (for example, "data-flow"). Click the **Add** button.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scdf_managing_instances_img_instance_name) %>

When the service instance has been provisioned, click its listing in the **Services** list.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scdf_managing_instances_img_service_successfully_added) %>

Click **Manage** to load the dashboard for the service instance.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scdf_managing_instances_img_manage_link) %>

The dashboard displays the list of available applications, along with stream and task definitions, and provides controls for defining new streams or tasks as well as for registering new applications.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scdf_managing_instances_img_new_dashboard) %>
   
## <a id="deleting"></a>Deleting an Instance

You can delete a Data Flow service instance using either the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) or <%= vars.scdf_platform_name %> Apps Manager. Deleting a Data Flow service instance will result in deletion of all of its dependent service instances.

### <a id="deleting-using-cf-cli"></a>Using the cf CLI

Begin by targeting the correct org and space.

<%= partial vars.scdf_managing_instances_target %>

You can view all service instances in the space using `cf services`.

<%= partial vars.scdf_managing_instances_services %>

Delete the Data Flow service instance using `cf delete-service`. When prompted, enter `y` to confirm the deletion.

<%= partial vars.scdf_managing_instances_delete %>

The dependent service instances for the Data Flow server service instance are deleted first, and then the Data Flow server service instance itself is deleted.

As the output from the `cf delete-service` command suggests, you can use the `cf services` or `cf service` commands to check the status of the service instance. When the Data Flow service instance and its dependent service instances have been deleted, the `cf services` command will no longer list the service instance:

<%= partial vars.scdf_managing_instances_delete_finished %>

### <a id="deleting-using-apps-manager"></a>Using Apps Manager

Log into Apps Manager as a Space Developer, navigate to the org and space of the service instance, and select the **Services** tab.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scdf_managing_instances_img_select_service) %>

Click the listing for the service instance. On the service instance's page, click **Delete Service Instance**.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scdf_managing_instances_img_delete_service) %>

Click **Delete Service Instance** to confirm the deletion.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scdf_managing_instances_img_confirm_deletion) %>

The dependent service instances for the Data Flow server service instance are deleted first, and then the Data Flow server service instance itself is deleted.
