title: Installing Flo
---

This section provides instructions for installing Flo for Spring Cloud Data Flow. 

The intent is to replace the UI jar within the Spring Cloud Data Flow distribution with a Flo enabled UI jar.  These are the steps:

1. Build Spring Cloud Data Flow. This will produce an admin jar in the spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VARIANT]/target subfolder with a name of the form: spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VARIANT]-[VERSION].jar

1. Move into the spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VARIANT]/target subfolder and optionally backup the jar you are about to patch:
cd spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VARIANT]/target
cp spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VARIANT]-[VERSION].jar spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VARIANT]-[VERSION].jar.original

1. Visit the <a href=”link!”>Flo product page</a> and download flo-spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VERSION].zip. The version should match the version of Spring Cloud Data Flow you are building. If it does not match it will be necessary to do an extra rename step as indicated below in order for the patch to apply properly, but even then it may not be totally compatible.

1. Whilst still in the target subfolder, unzip the flo zip file:
unzip flo-spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VERSION].zip
This will create a lib subfolder containing our patch jar to apply to the built jar.

1. If the version of flo downloaded does not exactly match the version of Spring Cloud Data Flow that was built, rename the jar in the lib folder such that it matches the Data Flow version:
mv lib/spring-cloud-dataflow-ui-[DOWNLOADED_VERSION].jar lib/spring-cloud-dataflow-ui-[BUILT_VERSION].jar
As mentioned earlier, if this rename step is necessary the jar may not be compatible.

1. Now, ensure you are in the target subfolder and apply the patch to the built jar:
jar -u0vf spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VARIANT]-[VERSION].jar lib
Note: the 0 is important since otherwise the extra compression damages the executable nature of the jar

1. The modified jar can now be run:
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-[VARIANT]-[VERSION].jar

1. Open your browser, clear your browser cache and now the admin UI should contain Flo extensions:
	Main dashboard: http://HOST_NAME:PORT/admin-ui
	Stream creation: http://HOST_NAME:PORT/admin-ui/#/streams/create

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If unchanged, the default PORT points to 9393.</p>
