title: Flo for Spring Cloud Data Flow
---

Flo is an HTML5 canvas application that runs on Spring Cloud Data Flow, offering a graphical interface for creating and monitoring streaming data pipelines.

## <a id='drag-drop'></a>Drag and Drop Interface ##

Flo allows you to create real-time streaming pipelines either with the textual shell or the "drag and drop" interface. For more information, see the [Building Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL3XnlOI9vQ&feature=youtu.be) and [Advanced Stream Creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os3WgPa-Axk&feature=youtu.be) tutorial videos.

The textual shell offers content-assist for stream definitions. Whether it is a source, processor, or sink, content-assist offers completion of module names and module options. This allows for rapid development, and is similar to the content-assist experience when writing code in an IDE. For more information, see the [Content Assist and Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyB5KVykaWQ&feature=youtu.be) tutorial video.

The textual and graphical views are kept in sync automatically. While working on a stream definition, you can switch them and still find an up-to-date representation of your pipelines.

Flo includes a palette with all out-of-the-box "data microservice" modules available in Spring Cloud Data Flow. The palette also includes a smart search filter for quick module lookup. Once you find your desired module, you can drag and drop the module to the canvas to create a new definition or augment an existing one.

Pipelines are composed of source, processor (0..n), and sink modules. Flo expects this structure and offers immediate feedback on any issues it finds. The textual shell displays error messages for syntax errors and other problems with stream definitions, such as if a module is specified with an unsupported option.
